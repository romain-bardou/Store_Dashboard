# Store Dashboard

üìã Overview

This project develops an analytical dashboard to optimize the performance of a global retail company's operations, leveraging a dataset of 50,000 transactions from 2021 to 2024. The dashboard transforms raw sales data into a strategic tool, enhancing revenue, reducing logistical costs, and strengthening market presence. Key insights highlight top-performing products, profitable regions, and areas for cost optimization.

üîç Objectives

    Transform raw transaction data into a structured star schema for multidimensional analysis.
    Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard with measures (sales, profit, cost, shipping, discount) and KPIs for year-over-year (YoY) analysis by segment and category.
    Conduct geographical analysis to identify high-performing products and regions, assess discount impacts, and evaluate logistical efficiency.
    Provide actionable insights to support strategic planning for 2025 economic challenges.
